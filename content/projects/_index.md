## 📝 Purpose and Objectives

This section exists to **document and share projects as a method of learning through doing**, while creating resources others can learn from. It serves three main purposes:

1. **Track progress**: Record ongoing work, ideas, and experiments to prevent them from languishing unfinished.
2. **Teach by example**: Show the steps, challenges, and insights gained so others can learn without starting from scratch.
3. **Bridge private and public work**: Present private analytical projects while also sharing open-source experiments, striking a balance between personal exploration and contribution to the wider community.

The guiding principle is simple: **knowledge is only potential power until applied.** These projects transform learning into action.

## ☕ Private Projects and Analytical Deep Dives

These are projects primarily for personal learning or private clients, focused on practical application and data-driven insights. Where possible, methodology, architecture, and lessons learned will be shared without exposing sensitive data.

### 1. Financial Data Analysis Pipeline for a Coffee Shop

* **Objective:** Build a complete end-to-end data pipeline to extract insights and predict trends for a small business.
* **Focus Areas:** Historical sales analysis, inventory optimization, pricing strategy, predictive modeling of customer traffic.
* **Learning Outcome:** Practical experience in transforming raw business data into actionable intelligence.

### 2. Bitcoin Transaction Analysis and Data Pipeline

* **Objective:** Gain deep technical understanding of blockchain data flows and analytics.
* **Focus Areas:** Transaction extraction and parsing, integrating live market prices, visualization of trends and patterns in economic activity.
* **Learning Outcome:** Mastering robust pipeline design and blockchain data interpretation.

### 3. Urbit Ecosystem Exploration and App Development

* **Objective:** Explore Urbit’s novel architecture and develop a practical app within its ecosystem.
* **Focus Areas:** Nouns, jets, vanes, ship setup, application design.
* **Learning Outcome:** Hands-on experience with a decentralized system and its unique programming paradigm.

## 🌐 Public Open-Source and Learning Logs

These projects are intended to **teach through transparency**, providing open resources, examples, and explanations for others to follow.

### 4. Computer Science / Forever Learning Repository

* **Objective:** Maintain an open-source educational repository documenting my learning in computer science.
* **Focus Areas:** Algorithms, data structures, operating systems, with annotated code examples and learning logs.
* **Learning Outcome:** Create a resource that others can use as a guide while also reinforcing my own understanding.

### 5. MonsterHunter_CLI Project

* **Objective:** Develop a themed command-line interface application as a practical programming exercise.
* **Focus Areas:** C# object-oriented design, terminal UI, data structure management.
* **Learning Outcome:** Documenting step-by-step technical development in a way that teaches coding principles through example.

## 📌 How This Section Can Teach Others

To make projects more than just a showcase, consider:

* **Step-by-step methodology breakdowns**: What tools, approaches, and decisions were made and why.
* **Annotated code or pseudo-code**: Explaining logic for learners, not just sharing files.
* **Lessons Learned sections**: Highlight successes, failures, and things you’d do differently.
* **Visualization of pipelines or workflows**: Diagrams showing data or process flow.
* **Interactive templates or simplified demos**: Let others experiment safely with your approach.

> The goal is not to display mastery, but to make the learning process visible, actionable, and reproducible.
